# Digit_recognition
Automatic digit recognition is of popular interest today.
Deep Learning techniques makes it possible for object recognition in image data .
The data set used for this problem is from the populat MNIST data set. Developed by Yann LeCun, Corina Cortes and
Christopher Burger for evaluating machine learning model on the handwritten digit classification problem. 
It is a widely used data set in the machine learning community.

This dataset contain 70000 images of digits 28*28 pixels
train contain 49000 images
test contain 21000 images
while csv files contain 2 columns with image name and label
